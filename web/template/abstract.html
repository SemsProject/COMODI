<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The COMODI ontology is needed because COmputational MOdels DIffer.
COMODI provides a set of classes and properties that empowers users and software to represent and describe changes in computational models on the semantic level.
COMODI also enables software to implement user-specific filter options for the display of model changes.
COMODI is the next step towards predicting how a change in a model influences the simulation study.

<strong>The OWL encoding</strong> of the COMODI Ontology is available <a href="comodi.owl"> from our web server.</a></br>
<strong>The namespace</strong> for all COMODI terms is <code>http://purl.uni-rostock.de/comodi/comodi#</code>.</br> 
<strong>Please cite COMODI </strong> as  </br>
