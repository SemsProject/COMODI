<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The COMODI ontology is needed because COmputational MOdels DIffer.
COMODI defines classes and properties to represent changes in computational models on the semantic level.
These terms empower users and software to describe model changes in detail.
Software can implement user-specific filter options for model changes and potentially predict how a change in a model influences a simulation study.

<strong>The OWL encoding</strong> of the COMODI Ontology is available from our web server: <a href="comodi.owl">comodi.owl</a>.<br />
<strong>The namespace</strong> for all COMODI terms is <code>http://purl.uni-rostock.de/comodi/comodi#</code>.<br />
